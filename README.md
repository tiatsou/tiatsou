:octocat: Hi, I’m Der-Hsuan Tsou. You can also call me Tia if it is easiler for you.

⭐ I’m interested in data anaytics, business analytics and data visualing to let your data tell a different story.

💻 I recently earned the certificate for Google Data Analytics Specialization. And I am currently learning Spark computing.

💼 I’m looking for a Data Scientist/ Analyst related full-time job in the US and open to relocate.
